## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to voting patterns and policing. I think it would be interesting to look at election results in states with a lot of gerrymandering and see if there are any patterns/relationships that can be found in terms of which parties historically win wide. Another thing I'd be interested in exploring is patterns of the school to prison pipeline in schools that are over-policed, and whether or not there is evidence of racial discrimination here as well.
